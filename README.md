# DMMLogger
**Simple logger for VISA multimeters**

- If you only want the executable file, it is this: [C#\DMMLog\bin\Release\DMMLog.exe](https://github.com/kaktus85/DMMLogger/blob/master/C%23/DMMLog/bin/Release/DMMLog.exe) (click download when you get on the page).
- You will need to install [National Instruments NI-VISA package](http://search.ni.com/nisearch/app/main/p/bot/no/ap/tech/lang/cs/pg/1/sn/catnav:du,n8:3.1637.1640,ssnav:sup/). This version works with NI-VISA 16.0.
- You can assign easier-to-work-with name for your VISA instrument using the NI Measurement & Automation Explorer (NIMax.exe), which is included in the NI-VISA installation package.
